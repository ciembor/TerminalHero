# Terminal Hero
__Linux society's response to Guitar Hero. :)__

## Installation
This game is written in Perl language, so it depends on __perl__ interpreter.
It also needs __libtermkey__ and some extra Perl __modules__:

* Term::ReadKey
* Term::TermKey
* POE
* POE::Wheel::TermKey

If you don't know how to install Perl __modules__, look at [How to install CPAN modules](http://www.cpan.org/modules/INSTALL.html).
If you have problems with installation of __Term::TermKey__, make sure that __libtermkey__ is available in your operating system. If not - [Installing Term::TermKey returns error](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8287071/installing-termtermkey-returns-error) should help you.

To install Terminal Hero type in your shell:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

In ArchLinux you can use existing PKGBUILD for this game from AUR:

    yaourt -S terminalhero-git

The binary will be installed in:

    /usr/bin/vendor_perl

You might have to relogin or update your PATH variable by hand.
